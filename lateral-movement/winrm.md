# WinRM

WinRM is a Microsoft technology that enables remote management and automation of Windows-based systems. It's especially valuable in enterprise environments where IT administrators need to manage multiple Windows servers and workstations.

WinRM, or Windows Remote Management, is a legitimate Windows management tool that can be misused for lateral movement by threat actors during cyberattacks.
